          <h4>INSTEPCART INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED E-WASTE RECYCLING POLICY</h4>
          <p className="margin_bottom">
            The Information and Communication revolution has brought enormous
            changes in the way we organize our lives, our economies, industries
            and institutions. These spectacular developments in modern times
            have undoubtedly enhanced the quality of our lives, but at the same
            time, have led to manifold problems including the problem of massive
            amount of hazardous waste and other waste generated from electric
            products. Such waste poses a serious threat to human health and
            environment. The issue of proper management of such hazardous
            E-Waste is therefore critical to the protection of livelihood,
            health and environment.
          </p>
          <p className="margin_bottom">
            To deal with this ever-rising problem of E-Waste, the government of
            India, through its Ministry of Environment and forest, formulated
            the E-Waste (Management and Handling) Rules in 2016.

          <h4 className="margin_bottom">
            INSTEPCART INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED STANDS COMMITTED TO IMPLEMENT THE
            E-WASTE UNDER E-WASTE RULES.
          </h4>
          <h6 className="margin_bottom">
            The Basel Convention defines wastes as-
          </h6>
          <p>
            “Substances or objects, which are disposed off or are intended to be
            disposed off, or are required to be disposed off by the provisions
            of national laws”
          </p>
          <h6>E waste has been defined as-</h6>
          “Waste electrical and electronic equipment, whole or in part or
          rejects from their manufacturing and repair process, which are
          intended to be discarded.”
          <p className="margin_bottom">
            Whereas, Electrical and electronic equipment has been defined as:-
          </p>
          <p className="margin_bottom">
            "Equipment which is dependent on electrical currents or
            electro-magnetic fields to fully functional".
          </p>
          <p className="margin_bottom">
            Like hazardous waste, the problem of e-waste has become an immediate
            and long-term concern as its unregulated accumulation and recycling
            can lead to major environmental problems endangering human health.
            This calls for an urgent need for E-Waste Management so as to
            preserve the ecological balance and reduce landfills. Recycling
            end-of-life products is vital if we are to save resources and
            minimize waste. In this regard, we at INSTEPCART India private limited
            have tied up with Reteck Envirotech Pvt. Ltd, one of the world’s
            largest authorized E-Waste recycler, for facilitating our
            Organization and our customers to enable them to dispose E-Waste
            products after its end-of-life.
